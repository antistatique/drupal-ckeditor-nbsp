# CKEditor Non-breaking space Plugin

Minimal module to insert a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`)
into the content by pressing Ctrl+Space or using the provided button.

## Uses

During content creation the author may add a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`)
to prevent an automatic line break.
To avoid that a companyâ€™s 2-word name is split onto 2 separate lines.

As the non-breaking space is an invisible character,
they are highlighted in blue on the CKEditor.

## Installation

Install the module then follow the instructions
for installing the CKEditor plugins below.

## Configuration

Go to the [Text formats and editors](/admin/config/content/formats)
configuration page:, and for each text format/editor combo
where you want to use NBSP, do the following:

* Drag and drop the 'NBSP' button into the Active toolbar.
* Enable filter "Cleanup NBSP markup".
* if the "Limit allowed HTML tags and correct faulty HTML" filter is disabled
you dont have anything to do with this text format.
Otherwise, add `<nbsp>` in the "allowed HTML tags" field.

## Which version should I use?

NBSP is now available for both Drupal 8, Drupal 9 & Drupal 10!
